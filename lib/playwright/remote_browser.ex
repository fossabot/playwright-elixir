  # - In versions of playwright server before `1.11.0`, the guid of this message
  #   is `remoteBrowser`.
  # - When connecting to versions of playwright server older than `1.11.0`, the
  #   `Playwright.Playwright` does not exist. Clients should instead block on this
  #   message to know that the browser is available.
