defmodule Playwright.BrowserContext do
  @moduledoc """
  `Playwright.BrowserContext` provides a way to operate multiple independent
  browser sessions.

  If a page opens another page, e.g. with a `window.open` call, the popup will
  belong to the parent page's browser context.

  Playwright allows creation of "incognito" browser contexts with the
  `Playwright.Browser.new_context/1` function.

  ## Example

      # create a new "incognito" browser context:
      {:ok, context} = Playwright.Browser.new_context(browser)

      # create and use a new page within that context:
      {:ok, page} = Playwright.BrowserContext.new_page(context)
      {:ok, resp} = Playwright.Page.goto(page, "https://example.com")

      # dispose the context once it's no longer needed:
      Playwright.BrowserContext.close(context)

  ## Regarding `expect_event/5` and `on/3`

  The first argument given to `on/3` and `expect_event/5` functions is the
  "owner" on which to bind the event.

  The second argument is the event type.

  The third argument is a callback function that will be executed when the
  event fires, and is passed an instance of `Playwright.Runner.EventInfo`.

  ### Details for `expect_event/5`

  Calls to `expect_event/5` are blocking. These functions take a "trigger",
  execution of which is expected to result in the event being fired.

  If the event does not fire within the timeout window, the call to
  `expect_event/5` will timeout.

  An optional "predicate" function may be provided, in which case the fired
  event will be sent to the predicate, which must return a "truthy" result
  in order for the expectation to be fulfilled.

      {:ok, e } = BrowserContext.expect_event(context, :close, fn ->
        Page.close(page)
      end)
      assert %BrowserContext{} = e.target

  ### Details for `on/3`

  Calls to `on/3` are non-blocking and register callbacks for the lifetime
  of the binding target.

      BrowserContext.on(context, :close, fn e ->
        assert %BrowserContext{} = e.target
      end)

  ### Event types

  The `expect_event/5` and `on/3` functions support the following event types:

    - `:background_page`

      Emitted when a new background page is created in the context. The event
      target is a `Playwright.Page`.

          ...

      > NOTE:
      > - Only works with Chromium browser's persistent context.

    - `:close`

      Emitted when the `Playwright.BrowserContext` is closed. The event target
      is a `Playwright.BrowserContext`. This might happen because of any of the
      following:

        - Browser context is closed.
        - Browser application is closed or crashed.
        - `Playwright.Browser.close/1` is called.
        - `Playwright.Page.close/1` is with the "owner page" for this context.

    - `:page`

      Emitted when a new `Playwright.Page` is created within the context.
      The page may still be loading. The event target is a `Playwright.Page`.

      The event will also fire for popup pages.

      The earliest moment that a page is available is when it has navigated to
      the initial URL. For example, when opening a popup with
      `window.open('http://example.com')`, this event will fire when the
      network request to "http://example.com" is done and its response has
      started loading in the popup.

          BrowserContext.expect_event(context, :page, fn ->
            Page.click(page, "a[target=_blank]")
          end)

      > NOTE:
      > - Use `Playwright.Page.wait_for_load_state/3` to wait until the page
      >   gets to a particular state (you should not need it in most cases).

    - `:request`

      Emitted when a request is issued from any pages created through this
      context. The event target is a `Playwright.Request`.

      To only listen for requests from a particular page, use
      `Playwright.Page.on/3` (for `:request`).

      In order to intercept and mutate requests, see `route/4` or
      `Playwright.Page.route/4`.

    - `:request_failed`

      Emitted when a request fails, for example by timing out. The event
      target is a `Playwright.Request`.

      To only listen for failed requests from a particular page, use
      `Playwright.Page.on/3` (for `:request_failed`).

      > NOTE:
      > - HTTP error responses, such as 404 or 503, are still successful
      >   responses from HTTP standpoint. So, the request will complete with
      >   a `:request_finished` event and not with `:request_failed`.

    - `:request_finished`

      Emitted when a request finishes successfully after downloading the
      response body. The event target is a `Playwright.Request`.

      For a successful response, the sequence of events is `:request`,
      `:response` and `:request_finished`. To listen for successful requests
      from a particular page, use `Playwright.Page.on/3` (for
      `:request_finished`).

    - `:response`

      Emitted when response status and headers are received for a request.
      The event target is a `Playwright.Response`.

      For a successful response, the sequence of events is `:request`,
      `:response` and `:request_finished`. To listen for response events
      from a particular page, use `Playwright.Page.on/3` (for  `:response`).

    - `:service_worker`

      Emitted when new service worker is created in the context. The event
      target is a `Playwright.Worker`.

      > NOTE:
      > - Service workers are only supported on Chromium-based browsers.
