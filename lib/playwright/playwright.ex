  # When launching a browser or connecting to a running Playwright server, a
  # `Playwright.Playwright` message from the server indicates that the browser is
  # ready for action.

  # When connecting to a Playwright websocket server, the `initializer`
  # property will include a key `preLaunchedBrowser`, which can be used to
  # look up the browser guid.

  # ## Payload

  #     {
  #       "guid":"",
  #       "method":"__create__",
  #       "params":{
  #         "type":"Playwright",
  #         "initializer":{
  #           "preLaunchedBrowser":{"guid":"browser@guid"}
  #           ...
  #         }
  #       }
  #     }

  # ## Notes

  # * When Playwright is started, the client blocks to wait for this message
  #   to have been received. If the Playwright server is older than `v1.11.0`, the
  #   server sends the `Playwright.RemoteBrowser` message instead.
  # @moduledoc since: "Playwright 1.11.0"
