  The `Playwright.BrowserType` module exposes functions that either:

  - launch a new browser instance via a `Port`
  - connect to a running playwright websocket

  ## Examples

  Open a new chromium via the CLI driver:

      {connection, browser} = Playwright.BrowserType.launch()

  Connect to a running playwright instances:

      {connection, browser} = Playwright.BrowserType.connect("ws://localhost:3000/playwright")
